# Welcome to my Portfolio Website By Kamil Szczesiak!

## This project is a Portfolio Website to demenstrate my skills and experience

### Project Brief
 To achieve and complete this project, I need to create a portfolio website which achieves the following factors:
 * Have a Home Page / Section
 * Have a About Page / Section
 * Have a Contact Page / Section
 * Have a Projects Page / Section
 * Have good accessibility
 * Be Responsive
 * Include Graphics
 * Use 3 colours but keep it clean
 * Use Clean Code

 ### Approach
 How did I approach the brief?
 I began by planning out what pages I will need to include based on the brief, I then chose the colours and began creating the website, testing responsiveness as I developed the website.

 Biggest challenge?
 The biggest challenge in the developing of this project was the initial plan of this. Starting the project off was difficult as I wasn't quite sure how I wanted the website to look to stand out from the rest.

 ### Future Improvements
 If I had more time and better resources, how would I change or improve this project?

 If I did have more time, I'd like to spend more time on animations, to make certains areas slide in as the user scrolls to add some more interactivity and movement to the website. I could also add a day / night toggle which will let the user change between light mode and dark mode based on their preference.
